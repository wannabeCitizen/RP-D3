					<h2>Journals</h2>


					<p>The way homework is assigned in our instructional model involves doing a series of challenges that step students through different aspects of the tool they are learning.  These challenges start simple - e.g., downloading and installing the packages - and end with a fully functional use of the tool.  In this way students are actively <em> engaging</em> with their skills by <em>doing</em> activities that integrate this new tool into their repertoire of abilities.  All work is submitted in the way of a <b>learning journal</b>, which is described further below.</p>


					<p>Each assignment also has a reflective compontent that asks students to give feedback about the content and their experience with our module.  We also ask questions about peer learning and problem solving to get a sense of how people are learning together and what extraneous resources they used to help them complete the assignment.  This feedback is collected in the learning journal by posing a series of questions at the end of each module we ask them to respond to prior to submission.</p>



					<p>Our current design has the assignment deployed on our class website which displays a document walking students through the challenges they are to complete.  Specific places where a submission is required are highlighted, which normally involves taking a screenshot or sharing a code snippet to prove the student has progressed to a certain point.  These submissions as well as responses to reflective questions are gathered through the <b>learning journal</b> which is a Google Presentation Document.  Each week we put up a template document that has slide for each submission as well as a slide for every journal question.</p>

					<h3>Challenge 3: Flask + SQLAlchemy</h3>
					<p>
						Read the section “A Minimal Application” and run the example code in a Python shell
						<br>
						<a href="http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/quickstart.html#a-minimal-application">http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/quickstart.html#a-minimal-application</a>
					</p>

					Hint: You will need to run these commands to install necessary packages.
					$ . venv/bin/activate
					$ pip install sqlalchemy
					$ pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy

					<p>
						Add one more user (yourself) to the User table.
						<br>
						<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/journal1.JPG') }}" alt text="Journal 1" rel="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Example Query">
					</p>

					<p>
						The string representation of a user object is not all that helpful. Modify the __repr__ method of the class User.  The goal is to be able to see both attributes of each user object like below. Also, no more <>’s (so later it can be displayed properly in a browser).

						<br>
						<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/journal2.JPG') }}" alt text="Journal 1" rel="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Example Attributes">
					</p>

					<p>
						Submission 3-a: Type the query like above in a Python interactive shell to show that there are three users (including yourself) and that they are displayed in the shell in the improved format. Take a screenshot of your terminal window and upload the screenshot to your journal.
					</p>

					<p>
						Now, modify your server code to respond to /users and display the result of User.query.all() as a string. (Hint: use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#str">str()</a>)

						<br>
						<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/journal3.JPG') }}" alt text="Journal 1" rel="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="DB info through Flask">
					</p>


					<p>
						Submission 3-b: Open your browser to /users and the output should be like above. Take a screenshot and upload it to your journal.

					<h3>Challenge 1: Grid System</h3>
					<p>
						Your first challenge is to learn how to use Bootstrap’s Grid system. You can start by reading the official documentation at <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid"> http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid</a> (skip LESS mixins and variables). 
					</p>

					<p>
						Apply what you just learned. Create a page illustrated like below. Use DIV exclusively. Do not use TABLE or TD or TR. Replace “Joseph Smith” with your own name.
					</p>

					<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/journal4.JPG') }}" alt text="Journal 1" rel="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Example Grid Layout -- Bootstrap">

					<p>
						Submission 1: Take a screenshot of the page you made and insert it into your journal.
