					<p>The way homework is assigned in our instructional model involves doing a series of challenges that step students through different aspects of the tool they are learning.  These challenges start simple - e.g., downloading and installing the packages - and end with a fully functional use of the tool.  In this way students are actively <em> engaging</em> with their skills by <em>doing</em> activities that integrate this new tool into their repertoire of abilities.  All work is submitted in the way of a <b>learning journal</b>, which is described further below.</p>


					<p>Each assignment also has a reflective compontent that asks students to give feedback about the content and their experience with our module.  We also ask questions about peer learning and problem solving to get a sense of how people are learning together and what extraneous resources they used to help them complete the assignment.  This feedback is collected in the learning journal by posing a series of questions at the end of each module we ask them to respond to prior to submission.</p>



					<p>Our current design has the assignment deployed on our class website which displays a document walking students through the challenges they are to complete.  Specific places where a submission is required are highlighted, which normally involves taking a screenshot or sharing a code snippet to prove the student has progressed to a certain point.  These submissions as well as responses to reflective questions are gathered through the <b>learning journal</b> which is a Google Presentation Document.  Each week we put up a template document that has slide for each submission as well as a slide for every journal question.</p>
